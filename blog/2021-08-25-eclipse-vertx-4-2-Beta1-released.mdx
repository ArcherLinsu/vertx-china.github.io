We are extremely pleased to announce the first beta of Vert.x 4.2.

## Reactive Oracle Client

The [Reactive Oracle Client](https://vertx.io/docs/4.2.0/vertx-oracle-client/java/) joins the [database clients](https://vertx.io/docs/#databases) family!

This client is in tech preview and we are eager to hear any feedback you may have.

## MQTT Server V5 supports

The MQTT Server has been upgraded to support the version 5 of the protocol partially (the auth message remains to be implemented)

## Finally

This is the first beta release of Vert.x 4.2. You can of course expect more as we get feedback from the community and fix issues that we failed to catch before.

[Deprecations and breaking changes](https://github.com/vert-x3/wiki/wiki/4.2.0-Deprecations-and-breaking-changes)
 can be found on the wiki.

For this release, there are no Docker images.

The release artifacts have been deployed to [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:io.vertx%20AND%20v:4.2.0.Beta1) and you can get the distribution on [Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/vertx/vertx-stack-manager/4.2.0.Beta1/).

You can bootstrap a Vert.x 4.2.0.Beta1 project using https://start.vertx.io.

The documentation has been deployed on the web-site: https://vertx.io/docs/4.2.0

That's it! Happy coding and see you soon on our user or dev [channels](https://vertx.io/community).
