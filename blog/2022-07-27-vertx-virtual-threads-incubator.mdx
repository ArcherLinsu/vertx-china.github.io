[JEP 425: Virtual threads](https://openjdk.org/jeps/425) aka _Loom_ is coming to the Java Platform as a preview in Java 19 after
a few years of development.

 This is a major event for the _reactive_ world that can redefine how developers write services. How this might happen
in practice remains *very* speculative and we believe there will be a wide spectrum of choice to write those services: from
your dad's classic J2EE servlet/JDBC to a modern event-driven micro service.

On that account, the Vert.x project is launching the [virtual thread incubator](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-virtual-threads-incubator) project to experiment
with virtual threads, currently containing an [async/await](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-virtual-threads-incubator/tree/main/vertx-async-await-incubator) implementation.

The community (i.e. you) is encouraged to test the incubator projects and provide feedback (bugs, missing features, etc.). The incubator
is also meant to centralize community experiments with virtual threads. Therefore, it can host any other virtual thread-based project.
