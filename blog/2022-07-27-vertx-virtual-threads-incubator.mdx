[JEP 425: Virtual threads](https://openjdk.org/jeps/425) aka _Loom_ is coming to the Java Platform as a preview in Java 19 after
a few years development.

 This is a major event for the _reactive_ world that can redefine how developers write services. How this might happen
in practice remains *very* speculative and we believe there will be a wide spectrum of choice to write those services: from
your father's classic J2EE servlet/JDBC to a modern event driven application.

For this matter, the Vert.x project is launching an incubator [project](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-virtual-threads-incubator to experiment
with virtual threads, hosting currently an [async/await](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Async/await) implementation.

The community (e.g you) is encouraged to test the incubator projects, provide feedback (bugs, missing features, ...). This incubator
is also meant to centralize community experiments with virtual threads, therefore it can host any other virtual thread based project.
