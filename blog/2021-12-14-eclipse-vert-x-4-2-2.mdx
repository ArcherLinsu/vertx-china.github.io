We are extremely pleased to announce that Eclipse Vert.x version 4.2.2 has been released.

Since the release of Vert.x 4.2.1, quite a few bugs have been reported. We would like to thank you all for reporting these issues.

In addition this release upgrade its dependencies for a couple of CVE that were reported recently

* Log4j 2.15.0 resolving [CVE-2021-44228](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44228)
* Netty 4.1.72.Final resolving [CVE-2021-43797](https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-wx5j-54mm-rqqq)

Note that Vert.x is not affected out of the box by CVE-2021-44228 and applications using Log4j do it on their own and can
take care of the upgrade independently of the version of Vert.x.

In addition, a couple of small features have been implemented since the previous release

- Client sharing which includes reference counting and event-loop pool size configuration
  - [HTTP client sharing](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-core/java/#_client_sharing)
  - [SQL pool sharing](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-pg-client/java/#_pool_sharing)
- [PostgreSQL Money type support](https://github.com/eclipse-vertx/vertx-sql-client/pull/1078)
- [HTTP Proxy WebSocket support](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-http-proxy/java/#_websockets)
- [SQLConnectOptions URI resolution](https://github.com/eclipse-vertx/vertx-sql-client/issues/767)
