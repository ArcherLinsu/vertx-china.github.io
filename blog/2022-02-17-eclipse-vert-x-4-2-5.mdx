We are extremely pleased to announce that Eclipse Vert.x version 4.2.5 has been released.

Since the release of Vert.x 4.2.4, quite a few bugs have been reported. We would like to thank you all for reporting these issues.

In addition a couple of small features have been added.

## HTTP Proxy interceptors

The `HttpProxy` has now an [interception API](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-http-proxy/java/#_proxy_interception) to implement use cases such as caching or filtering.

```java
proxy.addInterceptor(new ProxyInterceptor() {
  @Override
  public Future<Void> handleProxyResponse(ProxyContext context) {
    ProxyResponse proxyResponse = context.response();

    // Create a filtered body
    Body filteredBody = filter(proxyResponse.getBody());

    // And then let the response use it
    proxyResponse.setBody(filteredBody);

    // Continue the interception chain
    return context.sendResponse();
  }
});
```

## Oracle client pooling

Our Oracle client now gets a proper pool implementation based on the same common pool used by other clients.

The [4.2.5 release notes](https://github.com/vert-x3/wiki/wiki/4.2.5-Release-Notes) as well as
[deprecations and breaking changes](https://github.com/vert-x3/wiki/wiki/4.2.5-Deprecations-and-breaking-changes)
 can be found on the wiki.

You can bootstrap a Vert.x 4 project using [start.vertx.io](https://start.vertx.io).

The release artifacts have been deployed to [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:io.vertx%20AND%20v:4.2.5) and
you can get the distribution on [Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/vertx/vertx-stack-manager/4.2.5/).

The [Vert.x 4 eventbus JavaScript client library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vertx/eventbus-bridge-client.js) is now available
in a single location and it now usable standalone or it can easily be integrated with any frontend build tool.

The Vert.x distribution is available from [SDKMan](https://sdkman.io) and our
[HomeBrew TAP](https://github.com/vertx-distrib/homebrew-tap).

Docker images are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/vertx/).

That's it! Happy coding and see you soon on our user or dev [channels](https://vertx.io/channels).
