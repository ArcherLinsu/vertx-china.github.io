  Eclipse Vert.x Webauthn version 4.2.2.1 has just been released.
---

Users of the module `vertx-auth-webauthn` should have noticed that since this morning, you cannot start any webauthn
application. The reason is that the root certificate for Android safety net attestation has expired.

The root certificate has been replaced with:

```
 https://aboutssl.org/globalsign-root-certificates-licensing-and-use/
  Name 	gsr1
  Thumbprint: b1:bc:96:8b:d4:f4:9d:62:2a:a8:9a:81:f2:15:01:52:a4:1d:82:9c
  Valid Until 	28 January 2028
```

Users should only update this dependency until an upgrade to a regular next full stack release.

Happy coding and see you soon on our user or dev [channels](https://vertx.io/channels).
