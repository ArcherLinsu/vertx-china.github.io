A recent [CVE-2021-44228](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44228) has been disclosed that affects the Log4j 2 library.

The Vert.x project can *optionally* use this library for logging but *does not ship* or *directly depends on * this library and therefore is not affected by this CVE.

In practice an application using Vert.x might use it but needs to explicitly depend on this library, in such case the Log4j 2
dependency version *must* be upgraded to 2.15.0 or later.

The Vert.x team will provide this week Vert.x patch releases that update the optional or test dependencies of Log4j 2:

- Vert.x 4.2.2 which was expected to be delivered soon and contains other bug fixes
- Vert.x 4.1.7 the previous stable branch
- Vert.x 3.9.11 the last stable branch of Vert.x 3 will is supported until end of 2022
