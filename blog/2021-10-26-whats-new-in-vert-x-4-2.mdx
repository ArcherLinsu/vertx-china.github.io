Vert.x 4.2 comes with plenty of new exciting features.

Here is an overview of the most important features supported in Vert.x 4.2.

## Java 17

Vert.x 4.2 comes with official support of Java 17.

Our CI has been updated to test from our Java 8 baseline to the very recent Java 17 release.

## Reactive SQL Client

### Oracle client

The [Reactive Oracle Client](https://vertx.io/docs/4.2.0/vertx-oracle-client/java/) joins the [database clients](https://vertx.io/docs/#databases) family!

This client is in tech preview and we are eager to hear any feedback you may have.

### MSSQL client TLS and Azure support

Our MSSQL client now supports TLS encryption as well as Azure support.

## MQTT Server V5 supports

The MQTT Server has been upgraded to support the version 5 of the protocol partially (the auth message remains to be implemented).

### Tracing

Our Cassandra client now supports tracing, you can use it either with your favourite tracer.

## Web Client enhancements

Our Web Client supports now Oauth2 automated token security management.

```java
WebClient client = WebClient.create(vertx);
OAuth2WebClient oauth2 = OAuth2WebClient.create(
    client,
    OAuth2Auth.create(vertx, new OAuth2Options(/* enter IdP config */)))

  // configure the initial credentials (needed to fetch if needed
  // the access_token
  .withCredentials(new TokenCredentials("some.jwt.token"));
```

Tokens are now fetched or refreshed during the lifecycle of the client.

It also offers an HTTP response caching facility.

```java
WebClient client = WebClient.create(vertx);
WebClient cachingWebClient = CachingWebClient.create(client);
```

## Auth enhancements

### Webauthn

Webauthn now supports [MDS3](https://fidoalliance.org/metadata/). The now "legacy" MDS2 is still available as the service is expected to be running until Nov 2022. In terms of usage, nothing changed, the module can identify the metadata version from the payload and decide how to handle it internally.

### OTP

A new module and handler for 2nd factor authentication is now available:

```java
OtpAuthHandler otp = OtpAuthHandler.create(TotpAuth.create();

otp
  // the issuer for the application
  .issuer("Vert.x Demo")
  // handle code verification responses
  .verifyUrl("/verify-otp.html")
  // handle registration of authenticators
  .setupRegisterCallback(router.post("/otp/register"))
  // handle verification of authenticators
  .setupCallback(router.post("/otp/verify"));
```

This module and handler are compatible with google authenticator and similar apps.

## OpenAPI

When using OpenAPI and eventbus deployed services, when deploying secure APIs, the HTTP `Authorization` header is now propagated along with the request all the way with the request on the eventbus. This paves the way to create a `Zero Trust` foundation for vert.x distributed applications.
