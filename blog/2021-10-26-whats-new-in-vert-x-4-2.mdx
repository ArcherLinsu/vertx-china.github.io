Vert.x 4.2 comes with plenty of new exciting features.

Here is an overview of the most important features supported in Vert.x 4.2.

## Java 17

Vert.x 4.2 comes with official support of Java 17.

Our CI has been updated to test from our Java 8 baseline to the very recent Java 17 release.

## Reactive SQL Client

### Oracle client

The [Reactive Oracle Client](https://vertx.io/docs/4.2.0/vertx-oracle-client/java/) joins the [database clients](https://vertx.io/docs/#databases) family!

This client is in tech preview and we are eager to hear any feedback you may have.

### MSSQL client TLS and Azure support

Our MSSQL client now supports TLS encryption as well as Azure support.

## MQTT Server V5 supports

The MQTT Server has been upgraded to support the version 5 of the protocol partially (the auth message remains to be implemented).

### Tracing

Our Cassandra client now supports tracing, you can use it either with your favourite tracer.

## Web Client enhancements

Our Web Client supports now Oauth2 security.

```java
WebClient client = WebClient.create(vertx);
OAuth2WebClient oauth2 = OAuth2WebClient.create(
    client,
    OAuth2Auth.create(vertx, new OAuth2Options(/* enter IdP config */)))

  // configure the initial credentials (needed to fetch if needed
  // the access_token
  .withCredentials(new TokenCredentials("some.jwt.token"));
```

It also offers an HTTP response caching facility.

```java
WebClient client = WebClient.create(vertx);
WebClient cachingWebClient = CachingWebClient.create(client);
```
