We are extremely pleased to announce that Eclipse Vert.x version 3.9.14 has been released.

The [3.9.14 release notes](https://github.com/vert-x3/wiki/wiki/3.9.14-Release-Notes) can be found on the wiki.

The 3.9 line is reaching end of life by the end of 2022 and we do recommend [upgrading to Vert.x 4](https://vertx.io/blog/from-vert-x-3-to-vert-x-4/).

The Vert.x distribution is available from [SDKMan](http://sdkman.io/index.html) and our [HomeBrew TAP](https://github.com/vertx-distrib/homebrew-tap). The
legacy Homebrew _vert.x_ formula will provide the latest Vert.x 4 release and therefore you should drop this formula and use the new _vertx3_ formula
from the new TAP.

The event bus client using the SockJS bridge is available from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vertx/eventbus-bridge-client.js).

The release artifacts have been deployed to [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22io.vertx%22%20AND%20v%3A%223.9.14%22) and you can get the distribution on [Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/vertx/vertx-stack-manager/3.9.14/).

That's it! Happy coding and see you soon on our user or dev [channels](https://vertx.io/community).
