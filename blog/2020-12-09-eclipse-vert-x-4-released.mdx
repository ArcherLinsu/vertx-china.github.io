We are extremely pleased to announce the release of Vert.x 4.

## What's new in Vert.x 4?

Vert.x 4 is the evolution of the Vert.x 3.x series that brings [key features](https://vertx.io/blog/whats-new-in-vert-x-4/) to Vert.x.

## From Vert.x 3 to Vert.x 4

Vert.x 4 extends the Vert.x 3 line with a set of new features while providing the same Vert.x 3 experience:
Vert.x 3 users will feel at home with Vert.x 4.

Vert.x 3 users migrating to Vert.x 4 should read this [page](https://vertx.io/blog/from-vert-x-3-to-vert-x-4/).

## Without the community we are nothing

The [community](https://vertx-web-site.github.io/community/) of people made Vert.x 4 a reality.

Special thanks go to Michel Kr√§mer the creator of this absolutely stunning Website.

## Finally

The [deprecations and breaking changes](https://github.com/vert-x3/wiki/wiki/4.0.0-Deprecations-and-breaking-changes)
 can be found on the wiki.

For this release there are no Docker images (????)

The release artifacts have been deployed to [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:io.vertx%20AND%20v:4.0.0) and you can get the distribution on [Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/vertx/vertx-stack-manager/4.0.0/).

The [Vert.x 4 eventbus JavaScript client library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vertx/eventbus-bridge-client.js) is now available in a single location and it now usable standalone or it can easily be integrated with any frontend build tool.

You can bootstrap a Vert.x 4 project using https://start.vertx.io.

That's it! Happy coding and see you soon on our user or dev [channels](https://vertx.io/community).
