We are extremely pleased to announce the release of Vert.x 4.

## What's new in Vert.x 4?

Vert.x 4 is the evolution of the Vert.x 3.x series that brings [key features](https://vertx.io/blog/whats-new-in-vert-x-4/) to Vert.x.

## From Vert.x 3 to Vert.x 4

Vert.x 4 extends the Vert.x 3 line with a set of new features while providing the same Vert.x 3 experience:
Vert.x 3 users will feel at home with Vert.x 4.

You can learn more about [migrating from Vert.x 3 to Vert.x 4](https://vertx.io/blog/from-vert-x-3-to-vert-x-4/).

## Without the community we are nothing

The [community](https://vertx-web-site.github.io/community/) of people made Vert.x 4 a reality.

Special thanks go to [Michel Kr√§mer](https://michelkraemer.com/) the creator of this absolutely stunning website.

## Finally

you can get the distribution on [Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/vertx/vertx-stack-manager/4.0.0/).

The [Vert.x 4 eventbus JavaScript client library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vertx/eventbus-bridge-client.js) is now available
in a single location and it now usable standalone or it can easily be integrated with any frontend build tool.

[HomeBrew TAP](https://github.com/vertx-distrib/homebrew-tap).

Docker images are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/vertx/).

That's it! Happy coding and see you soon on our user or dev [channels](https://vertx.io/channels).
