We are extremely pleased to announce that Eclipse Vert.x version 4.1.1 has been released.

Since the release of Vert.x 4.1.0, quite a few bugs have been reported. We would like to thank you all for reporting these issues.

This release also provides a few small features that were postponed from previous release.

## Sql Client pool enhancements

The pool supports now load balancing accross multiple servers:

```java
PgPool pool = PgPool.create(vertx, Arrays.asList(server1, server2);
```

There is a new hook for customizing connection after it has been created and before it is inserted in the pool:

```java
pool.connectHandler(conn -> {
  conn.query(sql).execute().onSuccess(res -> {
    // Release the connection to the pool, ready to be used by the application
    conn.close();
  });
});
```

## Finally

A few other noticeable improvements are available

* Jackson 2.11.4 upgrade
* MSSQL now supports batch queries as well as packet size configuration
* The PostgreSQL client now supports the `INET` data type
* MSSQL metadata version is now retrieved
* Redis Client exposes now pool metrics through the Vert.x metrics reporting
* HTTP server invalid request handler hook to customize invalid request responses
* Redis client fix for [well known Azure issue](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/431238/azure-redis-603-responding-incorrectly-to-hello-3.html)
* Mail client supports NTLM
