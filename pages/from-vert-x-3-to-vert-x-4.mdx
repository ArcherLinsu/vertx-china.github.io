# From Vert.x 3 to Vert.x 4

Vert.x 4 extends the Vert.x 3 line with a set of new features while providing the same Vert.x 3 experience: Vert.3
users will feel at home with Vert.x 4 .

## Migration

We have decided a few strategies to help the transition from Vert.x 3 to Vert.x 4.

When possible Vert.x 4 API have been made available in Vert.x 3 with a deprecation of the old API, giving
the opportunity to improve Vert.x 3 application with a better API while allowing application to be ready for a Vert.x 4
migration.

We provide a clear and documented [migration path](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-4-migration-guide/) from Vert.x 3.9
to Vert.x 4.0.

## Vert.x 3 support

Vert.x 3 will continue to get bug fix releases officially until January 2023.

Vert.x is an open source project of the Eclipse Foundation, granting the community the opportunity to contribute bug
fixes beyond that deadline.
