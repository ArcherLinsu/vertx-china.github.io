# Distributions


You can download the vert.x distributions.

The distributions are providing the vertx command line tool. To modify the content of the distribution once
downloaded, use the stack manager.

If you are using Apache Maven or Gradle, you don't need to download anything, as the required artifacts
are retrieved by your dependency manager.

## Downloads

You can browse available 4.x packages from [Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/vertx/vertx-stack-manager/) .

You can browse available 3.x packages from [Bintray](https://bintray.com/vertx/downloads/distribution/3.9.4/view) .
