# What's new in Vert.x 4

Vert.x 4 comes with plenty of new exciting features, some of them have been developed in Vert.x 3 and made available
as tech previews.

Here is an highlight of the most important features supported in Vert.x 4.

## Future model

Vert.x 4 uses futures over callbacks for modelling asynchronous operations.

## Distributed tracing

Monitor your microservices with Vert.x tracing supporting both [Opentracing](https://opentracing.io/) or [Zipking](https://zipkin.io/).

## Reactive SQL clients

A new set of high performance reactive SQL clients, fully integrated with Vert.x metrics and Vert.x tracing.

## SQL templating

SQL Client Templates is a library designed to facilitate the execution of SQL queries.

## Web

Web validation has never been so easy using the latest Json Schema standards thanks to Vert.x Web validation.

Web sessions can now be stored on a external database, redis as a backend is provided out of the box.

The revamped OpenAPI implementation uses it to enforce Contract Driven Development.

## Reactive Redis client

New client API with support for all redis connection modes, single, sentinel and cluster, with a full and extensible
support for redis commands.

## Authentication and Authorization

New modules are available

- `vertx-auth-properties` and `vertx-auth-ldap` to replace the deprecated `shiro` auth.
- `vertx-auth-sql` to work with reactive sql clients instead of blocking jdbc clients.
- `vertx-auth-webauth` as a FIDO2 verified implementation of FIDO2/Webauthn Relay Party.
