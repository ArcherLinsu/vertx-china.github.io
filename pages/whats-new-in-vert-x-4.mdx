# What's new in Vert.x 4

Vert.x 4 comes with plenty of new exciting features, some of them have been developed in Vert.x 3 and made available
as tech previews.

Here is an highlight of the most important features supported in Vert.x 4.

## Future model

Vert.x 4 uses futures over callbacks for modelling asynchronous operations.

## Distributed tracing

Monitor your microservices with Vert.x tracing supporting both [Opentracing](https://opentracing.io/) or [Zipking](https://zipkin.io/).

## Reactive SQL clients

A new set of high performance reactive SQL clients, fully integrated with Vert.x metrics and Vert.x tracing.

## SQL templating

SQL Client Templates is a library designed to facilitate the execution of SQL queries.

## Web Validation & OpenAPI

Web validation has never been so easy using the latest Json Schema standards thanks to Vert.x Web validation.

The revamped OpenAPI implementation uses it to enforce Contract Driven Development.

## Reactive Redis client

New client API with support for all redis connection modes, single, sentinel and cluster.

Underlying protocol upgraded to handle the new `RESP3` format (which allows richer types to be used).

Support for all redis commands (existing and future added ones), as well as, support for any redis extension is now
possible using the same single api.

## Authentication and Authorization

New modules `vertx-auth-properties` and `vertx-auth-ldap` to replace the deprecated `shiro` auth.

New module `vertx-auth-sql` to work with reactive sql clients instead of blocking jdbc clients.

New module `vertx-auth-webauth` as a FIDO2 verified implementation of FIDO2/Webauthn Relay Party.
