This directory is for the AsciiDoc source files of the Vert.x documentation.
Run the following command to download the source files from Maven central:

    ./gradlew

The source files will be copied to the `extracted` folder.

Please note, the recommended way to do this is, however, through running
`npm run update-docs` in the root directory of this project!
