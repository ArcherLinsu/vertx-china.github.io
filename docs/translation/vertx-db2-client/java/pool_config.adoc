=== Server load balancing

You can configure the pool with a list of servers instead of a single server.

[source,java]
----
DB2Pool pool = DB2Pool.pool(Arrays.asList(server1, server2, server3), options);
----

The pool uses a round-robin load balancing when a connection is created to select different servers.

NOTE: this provides load balancing when the connection is created and not when the connection is borrowed from the pool.

=== Pool connection initialization

You can use the `link:../../apidocs/io/vertx/sqlclient/Pool.html#connectHandler-io.vertx.core.Handler-[connectHandler]` to interact with a connection after it
has been created and before it is inserted in the pool.

[source,java]
----
pool.connectHandler(conn -> {
  conn.query(sql).execute().onSuccess(res -> {
    // Release the connection to the pool, ready to be used by the application
    conn.close();
  });
});
----

Once you are done with the connection, you should simply close it to signal the pool to use it.
